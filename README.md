# Anke-IPA-Keyboard
My IPA (International phonetic alphabet) keyboard layout created with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creater (MSKLC).
In "ankeipa.zip" are MSKLC generated installation files. Launch the installation file "setup.exe" in it to install and you can use it then.
"AnkeIPA.klc" is the original MSKLC source file, you can open it in MSKLC and build by yourself, or as your please.
A usage HTML in Chinese is here. Usage HTML in English is coming soon...
